# Day-1

## 30th July 2025
-It was our first day in Guru Nanak dev engineering college. 

-The day I waited from some recent days, Our college organized Shabad Kirtan which held in the religious Guruduwara present in the campus.

-In that fresh morning the shabad made us feel more refreshed and filled with love towards God.

-After that the college welcomed us with tea, snacks and sweet.

-The college entered our heart at first glance. Then we were called in the auditorium to attend our Inaugural     

-Ceremony where respected teachers welcomed us and addressed us about the college. Which helped me a lot to know about the institution

-The college looked beautiful and knowledgeable in which we were going to get knowledge as well as advice for our lives.

-And with this they ended the first welcome day which gave me a lot of determination to study at GNE college and opportunity to become a part of this family.--
